For languages that can not be encoded in ASCII, the regular file
"setup.tra" has been split into 4 different files:

* game.tra - This file holds all strings that are displayed in the
  game and need to be encoded in the character set used by the game
  (cp1252 for western-European languages, cp1251 for Russian and
  cp1250 for Polish).

* setup-win32.tra - This file holds all strings that are displayed
  during the installation on Windows and need to be encoded in the
  character set used by Windows terminals. However, to complicate
  matters, Microsoft changed the encoding with Windows Vista. Recent
  versions of Windows use cp1252 for western-European languages,
  cp1251 for Russian and cp1250 for Polish. Versions older than Vista
  use cp850, cp866 and cp852, respectively. Unfortunately there is no
  way to accommodate this change, so you have to choose whether to
  cater to older or newer Windows versions.

* setup-unix.tra - Like setup-win32.tra, except used for installations
  on Linux. Encoding should be UTF-8.

* setup-osx.tra - Like setup-win32.tra, except used for installations
  on Macs. Encoding should be in UTF-8.

As of version 2.0.3, the strings @0, @31, @32, @33, @34, @108 and @201
are displayed during the installation. All other strings are displayed
in the game.
